# modified version since we're not going to re-package Office 2016 for each new version:
#  - caching and not doing anything fancy
#  - repackaging each new versions
#  - modular approach (this script plus policy 90)
#
# parameter 4 = the name of the Office .PKG
# parameter 5 = the name of the Autoupdate .PKG
# parameter 6 = the name of the Volume Serializer .PKG
#
# remember to change these in the policy > Script > Options when you also change the Package
#
# things to do:
#  - add logic to check for existence of pkg in each step and bail if not present
#  - remove serializer and MAU into separate scripts?
#
# other ideas:
#  - break out into separate policies, call each from one master script/policy; better error checking
#
# first version deployed at MKB, Sept 2019, v1.0 PWC
# v1.1 PWC


# the actual Office install with choices applied

/usr/sbin/installer -pkg /Library/Application\ Support/JAMF/Waiting\ Room/$4 -target / -applyChoiceChangesXML /Users/Shared/.choices/choices.plist

# sleep a bit to let installer close gracefully
sleep 5

# latest Autoupdate

/usr/sbin/installer -pkg /Library/Application\ Support/JAMF/Waiting\ Room/$5 -target /

# another short sleep
sleep 5

# apply the Serializer (this probably won't change)
# ought to have a check for value, hardcode otherwise?
