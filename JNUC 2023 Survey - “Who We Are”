JNUC admin survey

Who we are (demos):
 - age, length of time in general industry, length of time specialized as MDM
 - gender, ethnicity (DEI)
 - industry (generalized) - how is education different than F100 than healthcare etc

What we use (tools):
 - Jamf, Intune, everything else - call out by device type
 - fleet composition - homogeneous vs mixed, legacy vs cloud

How big we are (fleet):
 - change in size over time? Did an Apple product drive a tool adoption or vv?
 - or did you / your org stay with the first choice?

How do tools impact fleet
How do demos impact fleet
Ergo how do demos impact tools - what is the role of your past experience in the choice of tools

Change over time:
- Did growing older / more experienced drive you into one or two tools? If so, what?
- Did growth of your fleet drive you to specialize in one or more tools?
- What if any tools did you use and then deprecate/replace?
- Did you start as a specialist and add something else, or vice versa?

Ask: what is biggest lack / vuln / need
Ask: if you could rewind, what would you do differently?

Takeaways: here is what these folks are doing, not what you should do (sort of same as Highland Battery Assessment)
 - it's not about best practices, it's about trends - what is most common for solutions
